Hi,

this is a super simple php router. The routes live inside the index.php. You have a few views where you can pass a title or enable the sidebar. And there is a layout file. So that you only have to edit the files in the views folder. Happy hacking! ðŸ––

First step, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mazzelman/PHP-Simple-Router.git
```

Second step, put the folder where you like. Inside the folder you can use the php development server.

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

then open the browser under http://localhost:8000

The folder structure looks like this:

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ psr.png
â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
â”œâ”€â”€ partials
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ footer.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header.php
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sidebar.php
â””â”€â”€ views
    â”œâ”€â”€ 404.php
    â”œâ”€â”€ about.php
    â”œâ”€â”€ home.php
    â”œâ”€â”€ layout.php
    â””â”€â”€ work.php
```
